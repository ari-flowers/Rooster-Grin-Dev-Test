### Write up questions:

1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)  
HTML, CSS(grid, flex), JS, React, Bootstrap, CSS Animate, Hover
Bootstrap was used for the carousel. 

2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose?
Yes! Lol. The carousel was a challenge and I redid it 3 times before I was finally happy with it. The first try, I attempted to build it with just HTML, CSS, and JS. That...didn't work. Bootstrap came to the rescue. 

3. What you enjoyed the most and why.
Grid! - it's one of those CSS staples that has been so ambiguous to me this entire time. This particular layout gave me a chance to really see how and why grid works - and the magic of it all clicking into place was such an aha moment for me.
